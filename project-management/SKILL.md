# Project Management

## Overview

Continuity is an agent-friendly cloud storage. Projects contain folders (nestable) and files at any level. This skill manages the top-level container: projects. In the API, projects and folders are both called **sessions** (`sessionType`: `creative_project` = project, `session` = folder).

Use this skill when an agent needs to:

- List, create, update, or delete projects
- Share or unshare projects with other users
- Browse a project's immediate contents (folders, entities, files)

For managing invitations to non-workspace members, see the **project-invitation** skill.

## Authentication

```
Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Or: `X-API-Key: $CONTINUITY_API_KEY`. See the **authentication** skill.

## Base URL

```
https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects
```

## Data Model

```

│   ├── Sub-folder
│   ├── Entity (asset)        character, motion, prop, environment, visdev, pose
│   │   └── Files
│   └── Files

└── Files
```

## Endpoints

### GET /v1/projects

List all projects accessible to the authenticated user. Use this to discover project IDs and their workspace context before browsing project contents.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sortOrder` | string | `asc` | Direction of the name sort: `asc`, `desc` |
| `limit` | integer | 500 | Results per page (1–1000) |
| `offset` | integer | 0 | Items to skip |

Results are always sorted by **project name** (case-insensitive); `sortOrder` only flips the direction. There is **no** `sortBy` on this endpoint — an unknown parameter is silently ignored, so never present the result as sorted by update time. To order by recency, sort the response client-side on `updatedAt` — and if the listing spans more than one page, fetch every page first: a single page is a name-ordered slice, so sorting one page alone does not yield the globally most recent projects.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "id": "...", "name": "My Project", "description": "...",
      "workspaceId": "...", "createdBy": "user@example.com",
      "sharedWith": ["collaborator@example.com"],
      "status": "active", "visibility": "private",
      "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..."
    }
  ],
  "workspaces": { "{workspaceId}": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "organizationId": "..." } },
  "organizations": { "{orgId}": { "id": "...", "name": "..." } },
  "total": 12, "limit": 500, "offset": 0
}
```

To resolve a project's workspace/org: `workspaces[project.workspaceId]` → `organizations[workspace.organizationId]`.

```bash
curl "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### POST /v1/projects

Create a new project. Name must be Windows filesystem-compatible.

**Where to get `workspaceId`:** From auth response `user.workspaces[].workspaceId` or from `GET /v1/projects`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Yes | Project name |
| `workspaceId` | string | Yes | Workspace ObjectId |
| `description` | string | No | Project description |
| `sharedWith` | string[] | No | Emails to share with |

**Response (201):** `{ messageCode, message, projectId }`

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 201 | Created |
| 403 | Not a workspace member |
| 409 | Name already exists in workspace |

```bash
curl -X POST "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My New Project", "workspaceId": "..."}'
```

---

### PATCH /v1/projects/{projectId}

Rename a project.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Yes | New project name |

**Response:** `{ messageCode, message, projectId }`

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects/{projectId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Renamed Project"}'
```

---

### DELETE /v1/projects/{projectId}

Soft-delete a project.

**Response:** `{ messageCode, message, projectId }`

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects/{projectId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

### GET /v1/projects/{projectId}/children

List a project's immediate contents — folders, asset entities, and files — as a **single unified `items` list**. Use this after `GET /v1/projects` to start browsing a project's top-level structure; use **folder-management** skill's `GET /v1/sessions/{folderId}/children` to navigate deeper.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sortBy` | string | `lastModified` | Sort key: `lastModified` \| `createdDate` \| `name` |
| `sortOrder` | string | `desc` | Sort direction: `asc` \| `desc` |
| `limit` | integer | 100 | Items in the unified list (max 500) |
| `offset` | integer | 0 | Items to skip in the unified list |

**Response:** `{ items: [...] }` — one flat array mixing folders, entities, and files. Each item carries a `type` discriminator (`"session"`, `"entity"`, or `"file"`) that selects its fields. An empty project returns `{ "items": [] }`.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "file",
      "id": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7ea",
      "name": "GUIDE",
      "fileFormat": "md",
      "fileSize": 1024,
      "key": "works_abc/sess_def/file_ghi",
      "presignedUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/..."
    },
    {
      "type": "session",
      "id": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8",
      "name": "storyboard",
      "sessionType": "session"
    },
    {
      "type": "entity",
      "id": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e9",
      "name": "Hero Character",
      "entityType": "character",
      "entityPreview": { "presignedUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/...", "key": "...", "fileFormat": "jpg" }
    }
  ]
}
```

| `type` | Meaning | Key fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session` | Folder | `sessionType` (`"session"`), `parentSessions` — navigate deeper via folder-management |
| `entity` | Asset | `entityType` (character, motion, prop, etc.), `entityPreview` (preview image) |
| `file` | File | `name` (mirrors the file's `fileName`), `fileFormat`, `fileSize`, `key`, `presignedUrl` (download URL) |

> **Parsing note:** Read the required top-level `items` array. Do not parse this
> endpoint as separate collections; an empty project is exactly `{ "items": [] }`.

```bash
curl "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/children" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

### POST /v1/projects/{projectId}/share

Share a project with another user. Behaves differently based on target's workspace membership:

- **Direct** (target is workspace member) → immediately added. Response: `type: "direct"`
- **Invitation** (target is NOT a member) → pending invitation created (7-day expiry). Response: `type: "invitation"`. See **project-invitation** skill.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | string | Yes | Target user's email |

**Response:** `{ messageCode, message, projectId, type }`

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Shared or invitation created |
| 400 | Cannot share with owner |
| 409 | Already shared or invitation pending |

```bash
curl -X POST "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "collaborator@example.com"}'
```

---

### DELETE /v1/projects/{projectId}/share/{email}

Remove a user from a shared project. **Owner only.**

**Response:** `{ messageCode, message, projectId }`

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/share/{email}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

### GET /v1/projects/{projectId}/share

List the project's sharing info. **Owner or shared user.**

**Response:** `{ owner: "owner@example.com", sharedWith: ["..."] }`

```bash
curl "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

### POST /v1/projects/{projectId}/leave

Leave a project shared with you. **Owner cannot leave.**

**Response:** `{ messageCode, message, projectId }`

```bash
curl -X POST "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/leave" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Common Patterns

### Browse a Project

1. Start with a project ID the user supplied or selected.
2. `GET /v1/projects/{id}/children` → inspect its immediate contents.
3. `GET /v1/sessions/{folderId}/children` → inspect a selected folder
   (folder-management skill).

### Agent Workflow: Project Discovery

For a named project, search its name directly:

```text
GET /v1/search?q={encodedQuery}&type=project&searchIn=name&limit=50
```

Read the grouped `{ data, count, cursor }` response and use each project
result's `sourceId`. This compatibility-safe recipe intentionally omits
`matchMode`, because generic search may target a deployment that predates that
parameter. Rank an exact case-insensitive `sessionName` match first, then a
normalized full-name match, then API relevance; ask the user to choose if the
result remains ambiguous. Do not enumerate every project's children to
discover a project or folder. For a named folder, use the bounded recipe in
**folder-management**.

### Studio URLs

| Resource | URL Pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Project | `https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/projects/{projectId}` |
| Folder | `https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/folders/{folderId}` |
| File | `https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/files/{fileId}` |

## Error Handling

| Code | Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | Invalid name (filesystem chars) or malformed ObjectId | Use Windows-compatible names, 24-char hex IDs |
| 401 | Expired or invalid token | Refresh via **authentication** skill |
| 403 | Not a workspace member or project owner | Check user permissions |
| 409 | Name conflict or duplicate share | Use different name or check existing shares |
