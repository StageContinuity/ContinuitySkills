# Folder Management

## Overview

Continuity is an agent-friendly cloud storage. Projects contain folders (nestable) and files at any level. This skill manages folders — they can be nested to any depth within a project.

Use this skill when an agent needs to:

- List recently created or updated folders across all accessible projects
- Find a named folder with bounded search rather than project-tree traversal
- Create, rename, move, or delete folders in a project
- Browse a folder's contents (sub-folders, entities, files)
- List assets or files within a folder
- Get download URLs for files in bulk

> **API terminology:** In the API, folders are called **sessions** (`sessionType: "session"`). All API fields use `sessionId`, `parentSessionId`, etc. This document uses **folder** for clarity.

## Authentication

```
Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Or use an API key:

```
X-API-Key: $CONTINUITY_API_KEY
```

See the **authentication** skill for obtaining tokens and managing API keys.

## Data Model

### Folder Hierarchy

```
Project (creative_project)          ← see project-management skill
├── Folder (session)
│   ├── Sub-folder (session)
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Entity (asset)              character, motion, prop, environment, visdev, pose
│   │   └── Files
│   └── Files
├── Entity (asset)
│   └── Files
└── Files
```

### Session Types

| `sessionType` | This document calls it | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `creative_project` | Project | Top-level container (managed via **project-management** skill) |
| `session` | **Folder** | Organizes content hierarchically |
| `entity` | Entity / Asset | Asset container (character, motion, prop, etc.) |
| `animation` | Animation | Animation session |

### Entity Types

Entities represent assets and have one of these types:

`character`, `motion`, `prop`, `environment`, `visdev`, `pose`

## Endpoints

### GET /v1/search/folders

<!-- continuity-agent
surfaces: ["local", "desktop", "backend", "hosted-web"]
webSafe: true
-->

Find existing project folders in one bounded request. The Search service runs
direct folder-name and contained-file evidence branches concurrently under the
same caller scope and eight-second ceiling, then returns deduplicated canonical
folders. Use this endpoint first for a named-folder request; do not enumerate
projects or recursively browse children to reproduce it client-side.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | string | Yes | — | Nonblank natural-language folder query (1–255 characters). |
| `workspaceId` | string | No | — | Restrict to one workspace already accessible to the caller. |
| `projectId` | string | No | — | Restrict to one project already accessible to the caller. |
| `limit` | integer | No | 5 | Maximum canonical candidates (1–10). |

**Response:**

```json

        { "id": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7d8", "name": "Works", "sessionType": "session" },
        { "id": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8", "name": "Phase 0", "sessionType": "session" }
      ],

      "evidence": {
        "directMatchCount": 1,
        "childFileCount": 0,
        "childFilenameCount": 0,
        "childContentCount": 0
      }
    }
  ],
  "count": 1,
  "status": "complete",
  "partial": false,
  "degradedBranches": [],
  "branchStatus": [
    { "branch": "direct_folder_name", "status": "ok" },
    { "branch": "file_evidence", "status": "ok" }
  ]
}
```

The documented response schema is exact:

| Object | Field | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `envelope` | `data` | array |
| `envelope` | `count` | integer |
| `envelope` | `status` | string |
| `envelope` | `partial` | boolean |
| `envelope` | `degradedBranches` | string[] |
| `envelope` | `branchStatus` | array |
| `result` | `folder` | object |
| `result` | `project` | object |
| `result` | `breadcrumb` | array |
| `result` | `matchStrength` | string |
| `result` | `reasonCodes` | string[] |
| `result` | `evidence` | object |
| `folder` | `id` | string |
| `folder` | `name` | string |
| `project` | `id` | string |
| `project` | `name` | string |
| `breadcrumb[]` | `id` | string |
| `breadcrumb[]` | `name` | string |
| `breadcrumb[]` | `sessionType` | string |
| `evidence` | `directMatchCount` | integer |
| `evidence` | `childFileCount` | integer |
| `evidence` | `childFilenameCount` | integer |
| `evidence` | `childContentCount` | integer |
| `branchStatus[]` | `branch` | string |
| `branchStatus[]` | `status` | string |

The response enums are also closed sets:

| Field | Exact values |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | `complete` \| `partial` |
| `degradedBranches[]` | `direct_folder_name` \| `file_evidence` |
| `matchStrength` | `exact` \| `strong` \| `supporting` |
| `reasonCodes[]` | `exact_folder_name` \| `direct_folder_name` \| `path_token_match` \| `child_filename` \| `child_content` |
| `breadcrumb[].sessionType` | `creative_project` \| `session` |
| `branchStatus[].branch` | `direct_folder_name` \| `file_evidence` |
| `branchStatus[].status` | `ok` \| `timeout` \| `error` \| `skipped` |

`breadcrumb` is ordered from the creative-project root through the matched
folder. `matchStrength` is exactly `exact`, `strong`, or `supporting`; it is a
stable qualitative tier, not a probability. `reasonCodes` may contain
`exact_folder_name`, `direct_folder_name`, `path_token_match`,
`child_filename`, and `child_content`.

Evidence is count-only. CheehooData does not return matching child file names,
file IDs, snippets, bodies, raw Atlas scores, or navigation URLs from this
endpoint. A hosted Studio tool may add `webUrl` fields; otherwise construct
`https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/folders/{folderId}` and
`https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/projects/{projectId}` from the canonical IDs.

`status: "partial"` and `partial: true` mean exactly one search branch degraded;
inspect `degradedBranches` and `branchStatus`, and present the surviving
candidates as partial. Each `branchStatus[].status` is exactly `ok`, `timeout`,
`error`, or `skipped`: `ok` means the bounded branch completed (even with no
matches), `timeout`/`error` identify degradation, and `skipped` means no search
ran because the caller's narrowed scope was empty. Service construction, scope
resolution, both evidence branches, and canonical hydration share one
eight-second ceiling. If that request budget expires, both branches are
unavailable, or canonical hydration fails, the request returns 503 instead of
silently traversing project trees.

**Status Codes:**

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Complete or explicitly partial canonical candidates returned |
| 400 | `search_query_too_broad`: query has no safe high-signal term or exceeds the bounded search breadth threshold |
| 401 | Invalid or expired credential |
| 403 | OAuth credential lacks the `read` scope |
| 422 | Missing/blank query, invalid limit, or malformed narrowing ID |
| 500 | Non-transient search or canonical-storage failure |
| 503 | `folder_discovery_unavailable`: shared request deadline expires, both evidence branches are unavailable, or canonical hydration fails |

**Example:**

```bash
curl "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/search/folders?q=PLOCAN%20Phase%200%20and%20A%20Works&limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### GET /v1/folders

<!-- continuity-agent
surfaces: ["local", "desktop", "backend", "hosted-web"]
webSafe: true
-->

List all folders the authenticated user can access across projects, globally sorted with containing project and workspace context. Use this for requests such as “show my recently created folders”; do not substitute projects for folders.

The default query returns the newest-created folders first. Nested folders are included at every depth, so no recursive project browsing is required.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sortBy` | string | `createdAt` | Global sort key: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, or `name` |
| `sortOrder` | string | `desc` | Sort direction: `asc` or `desc` |
| `limit` | integer | 50 | Results per page (1-200) |
| `offset` | integer | 0 | Number of globally sorted folders to skip |
| `workspaceId` | string | - | Restrict to one accessible workspace ObjectId |
| `projectId` | string | - | Restrict to one accessible project ObjectId |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "id": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8",
      "name": "Shot 010",
      "sessionType": "session",
      "description": "Latest shot work",
      "createdBy": "artist@example.com",
      "status": "active",
      "tags": ["shot"],
      "parentSessions": ["64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e0"],
      "projectId": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7d0",
      "projectName": "Feature Film",
      "workspaceId": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7c0",
      "createdAt": "2026-07-15T17:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-15T17:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0
}
```

`projectId`, `projectName`, and `workspaceId` identify each folder's container. An optional filter that selects no readable project returns an empty page rather than revealing whether an inaccessible folder exists.

**Status Codes:**

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Folders returned |
| 400 | Invalid workspace or project ObjectId filter |
| 401 | Invalid or expired token |
| 403 | OAuth credential lacks the `read` scope |
| 422 | Invalid sort or pagination query value |
| 500 | Internal server error |

**Example:**

```bash
curl "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/folders?sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

### POST /v1/sessions

Create a new folder.

**Description:** Creates a folder under a parent (project, folder, animation, or entity). The name must be compatible with Windows file system naming rules.

**Request Body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Yes | Folder name (Windows filesystem-compatible) |
| `parentSessionId` | string | Yes | Parent ObjectId (project, folder, animation, or entity) |
| `description` | string | No | Folder description |
| `tags` | string[] | No | Tags for the folder |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "messageCode": "success",
  "sessionId": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8"
}
```

**Status Codes:**

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Folder created |
| 400 | Invalid name, invalid parent ID, parent type not allowed, or entity nesting limit exceeded |
| 401 | Invalid or expired token |
| 403 | Not authorized to create in this parent |
| 404 | Parent not found or deleted |
| 409 | Folder name already exists in the parent |
| 500 | Internal server error |

**Nesting rules:**

- Allowed parents: `creative_project`, `session`, `animation`, `entity`
- Entity sessions allow only 1 level of sub-folders. Creating a folder under a folder that is already inside an entity is rejected.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Characters",
    "parentSessionId": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8",
    "description": "All character assets",
    "tags": ["characters"]
  }'
```

---

### PATCH /v1/sessions/{sessionId}

Update a folder (rename, move, or edit tags).

**Description:** Updates folder metadata. Supports renaming, moving to a different parent, and updating description/tags. Only folders (`sessionType: "session"`) can be updated via this endpoint.

**Path Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | Folder ObjectId |

**Request Body (all fields optional, at least one required):**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | New folder name |
| `description` | string | New description |
| `tags` | string[] | New tags |
| `parentSessionId` | string | Move to a new parent (project, folder, animation, or entity) |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "messageCode": "success",
  "sessionId": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8"
}
```

**Status Codes:**

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Folder updated |
| 400 | No fields provided, circular reference, or nesting limit exceeded |
| 401 | Invalid or expired token |
| 403 | Not authorized, or session is not a folder |
| 404 | Folder not found, or target parent not found |
| 409 | Name conflict in target parent |
| 500 | Internal server error |

**Move notes:**

- Moving a folder automatically inherits workspace and project IDs from the new parent.
- Circular references are detected and rejected (cannot move a folder into its own descendant).

**Examples:**

```bash
# Rename a folder
curl -X PATCH "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/sessions/64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Renamed Folder"}'

# Move a folder to a different parent
curl -X PATCH "https://data.stagecontinuity.com/api/v1/sessions/64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONTINUITY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"parentSessionId": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7f0"}'
```

---

### DELETE /v1/sessions/{sessionId}

**Path Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | Folder ObjectId |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "messageCode": "success",

### GET /v1/sessions/{sessionId}/children

List a folder's immediate contents — sub-folders, asset entities, and files. Use this to browse into a folder when you have its ID and want to see everything inside.

**Description:** Returns the direct children of a folder: sub-folders, entities (assets), and files. Same response format as `GET /v1/projects/{projectId}/children`.

**Path Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | Folder ObjectId |

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sortBy` | string | `lastModified` | Sort key: `lastModified` \| `createdDate` \| `name` |
| `sortOrder` | string | `desc` | Sort direction: `asc` \| `desc` |
| `limit` | integer | 100 | Items in the unified list (max: 500) |
| `offset` | integer | 0 | Number of items to skip in the unified list |

**Response:** `{ items: [...] }` — one flat array mixing sub-folders, entities, and files, sorted by the chosen key. Each item carries a `type` discriminator (`"session"`, `"entity"`, or `"file"`) that selects its fields. An empty folder returns `{ "items": [] }`.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "session",
      "id": "64a7b8c9d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8",

### GET /v1/sessions/{sessionId}/files

List the files directly in a folder (optionally flattened to include sub-folder files). Use this when you need file records for a known folder without browsing sub-folders.

**Description:** Returns files associated with a folder. By default, flattens results to include files from sub-folders via entity session linkage.

**Path Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionId` | string | Folder ObjectId |

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `flatten` | boolean | `true` | `true`: files by `entitySessionId` (includes sub-folders). `false`: files by direct `sessionId` only |
| `limit` | integer | 100 | Results per page (max: 500) |
| `offset` | integer | 0 | Number of items to skip |

**Response:**

```json

## Common Patterns

### List Recently Created Folders Across Projects

Call the global folder list directly; do not list projects and label them as
folders, and do not recurse through every project's children.

```text
GET /v1/folders?sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc&limit=20
```

### Find a Named Folder (Bounded Search-First Recipe)

Use search for requests such as “find the PLOCAN Phase 0 and A Works folder.”
Do not list every project or walk child endpoints to discover a folder by name.

1. Make the preferred one-call discovery request with the user's concise
   natural-language folder intent:

   ```text
   GET /v1/search/folders?q={encodedNaturalLanguageQuery}&limit=5
   ```

   Use the returned canonical `folder`, `project`, and root-to-folder
   `breadcrumb`. Preserve explicit partial status. Return or ask the user to
   choose among those candidates; do not perform client-side traversal.

2. **Compatibility fallback only:** use the following fixed legacy sequence
   only when the client tool registry does not contain `folder_find`, or an HTTP
   request to `GET /v1/search/folders` returns 404, 405, or 501. Those conditions
   confirm that the endpoint is absent. Do not fall back after a 400, 401, 403,
   422, 500, or 503 response, a timeout, or a network failure; surface that
   error instead.

   A deployment old enough to lack `folder_find` also lacks `matchMode` and may
   not return canonical `container`, `project`, or `breadcrumb` context from
   generic search. First separate the likely leaf-folder stem and requested
   leaf labels from hierarchy qualifiers. In the example above, search for
   `Phase`, retain the requested labels `0` and `A`, and keep `PLOCAN` / `Works`
   only as user-provided qualifiers. Do not claim that a result is beneath
   `PLOCAN / Works` unless the response itself supplies canonical context, and
   do not treat `Works` as the leaf. Do not send request verbs or the entire
   natural-language sentence as `{encodedQuery}`.

   Search folder name rows directly:

   ```text
   GET /v1/search?q={encodedQuery}&type=folder&searchIn=name&limit=50
   ```

   Read the grouped `{ data, count, cursor }` response. Each direct folder
   result proves that its `sourceId` is a folder ID. Rank an exact
   case-insensitive `sessionName` match first, then normalized requested-label
   matches, then the API relevance order. A folder result's canonical Studio
   URL is `https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/folders/{sourceId}`. Treat a legacy
   `projectId` as an opaque identifier; do not invent a project name or folder
   path when canonical context is absent.

   Only when the direct search returned at least two plausible folder
   candidates, the result is still ambiguous, and the request contains useful
   file/content terms, make **one** evidence fallback request. If direct search
   returned no folder candidates, stop and ask for a narrower name or project;
   file evidence cannot establish a folder identity by itself.

   ```text
   GET /v1/search?q={encodedQuery}&type=file&searchIn=all&limit=50
   ```

   Use concise evidence terms, not request verbs. Build a set of the direct
   folder results' `sourceId` values, then group returned file results by their
   containing `sessionId`. Count a file group only when its `sessionId` is in
   that direct-folder ID set. File evidence may re-rank an already-proven direct
   folder candidate, but it must never introduce a new folder candidate or
   establish hierarchy. This intersection also excludes project-root files,
   because a project ID was not returned as a direct folder `sourceId`.
   Nested descendant files are a known blind spot of this legacy evidence
   step: without canonical lineage, they cannot safely count toward an ancestor
   folder candidate. Treat zero direct-file evidence as inconclusive, not as
   proof that a folder is empty or irrelevant, and do not traverse descendants
   to compensate.

   Return the best candidates with only the context actually present and the
   supporting evidence counts. If the result is still ambiguous, ask the user
   to choose. Stop after the direct search and the single fallback: do not
   enumerate projects, call child endpoints, or recursively traverse folders
   for named-folder discovery.

`GET /v1/folders` is for globally sorted listing such as “recent folders”; it
is not the fallback for a name query.

### Browse a Known Folder

Use child endpoints only after the user supplied or selected an ID. They are
for inspecting a known container, not for finding a named folder.

1. **Get project children** (via **project-management** skill):

   ```
   GET /v1/projects/{projectId}/children → { items: [...] }
   ```

2. **Navigate into a folder:**

   ```
   GET /v1/sessions/{folderId}/children → { items: [...] }
   ```

3. Follow a returned sub-folder ID only when the user asks to inspect it.

### Create a Folder Structure

```bash
# Create a top-level folder in a project
POST /v1/sessions { name: "Characters", parentSessionId: "{projectId}" }
→ { sessionId: "folder1" }

# Create a sub-folder
POST /v1/sessions { name: "Heroes", parentSessionId: "folder1" }
→ { sessionId: "folder2" }
```

### Download All Files in a Folder

1. **List files** in the folder:

   ```
   GET /v1/sessions/{folderId}/files?flatten=true → { files: [...] }
   ```

2. **Get download URLs** in bulk:

   ```
   POST /v1/sessions/files/download/urls { fileIds: [...] }
   → { downloads: [{ downloadUrl, ... }] }
   ```

3. **Download** each file using its `downloadUrl`.

### Agent Workflow: Asset Discovery

1. **Find the folder** → use the bounded search-first recipe above
2. **Get assets** → `GET /v1/sessions/{folderId}/assets`
3. **Get files** → for each asset, list its files
4. **Download** → batch download with `POST /v1/sessions/files/download/urls`

### Studio URLs

After creating or finding resources, you can give the user a clickable link to view them in the browser:

| Resource | URL Pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Project | `https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/projects/{projectId}` |
| Folder | `https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/folders/{folderId}` |
| File | `https://folio.stagecontinuity.com/files/{fileId}` |

Studio resource URLs use only the target ID, regardless of folder depth.

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 (invalid name) | Name contains invalid filesystem characters | Use Windows-compatible names |
| 400 (nesting limit) | Trying to nest more than 1 level under an entity | Restructure: entities allow only 1 sub-folder level |
| 400 (circular ref) | Moving a folder into its own descendant | Choose a different target parent |
| 401 (unauthorized) | Expired or invalid JWT | Refresh token via **authentication** skill |
| 403 (not a folder) | Trying to update/delete a non-folder session | Only `sessionType: "session"` can be modified here |
| 404 (not found) | Folder doesn't exist or was deleted | Verify the folder ID |
| 409 (name conflict) | Folder name already exists in the parent | Use a different name |
